# Statics Project

The goal of this project is to develop a basic statistics program, using different programming languages, particularly: C++, Python, Javascript.

The program should: 
* read a *student-grades.txt* file from a directory
* calculate the *average*, the *standard deviation*, and the *mode* of the grades

The *student-grades.txt* files is organized so that:
* each line contains the student name, followed by the student grade; the data is separated by a comma
